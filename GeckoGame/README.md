## Build and run

Using the above indexing of scenes in build, start from the scene: Final_StartScreen.unity.

You can play the scenes individually, but the color customization will not save between scenes and navigation between scenes will be different.

## How to play
Use your mouse to navigate on screen menus and color selection, use arrows to navigate the rounds. Try to beat all three to win the collection game! Or, play in explore mode and collect as many mushrooms as you wish. Press 'esc' to quit. 

## Features implemented
Multiple scenes (MainMenuScript.cs), color customization scene (ColorPickerControl.cs and SVImageControl.cs), sound, data persistence between scenes (color) (MainManager.cs), pause button, improved collision detection throughout scene.
