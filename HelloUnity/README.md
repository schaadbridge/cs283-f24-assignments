# Assignment 3: Create a Virtual World -- Pine Tree Forest

I wanted to play around with scale here, so I made the controller relatively small and low to the ground (bug-like!), and might play around more with making the rest of the environment bigger in comparison.

Bird's eye view:

Home area! (within the fence, beyond the fence is the quest area)

## Animation
I used the [LowPoly ToonCat Lite](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/lowpoly-toon-cat-lite-66083) from class for this so I could play around with a skeleton with more levels of hierarchy!
